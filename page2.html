        <p id="moreparagraphText">Every year, millions of sharks will die because of the shark fin trade.  Often, the fin is cut off while the shark is still alive, and the shark is then thrown back into the ocean to suffer and die.  These fins are then used to make shark fin soup.</p>

          <p>While the United States has banned the practice of shark finning, as well as prohibiting boats from bringing shark fins back to the mainland on the federal level, people in the United States are still able to sell and purchase shark fins that were cut off in other places.  Furthermore, while some states have banned selling and purchasing shark fins, there is a lack of enforcement for these laws.  At some restaurants in these states, you can still purchase shark fin soup despite the laws against it.</p>

          <p id="moreparagraphText">Shark fins are also flavorless, and they are only put in the soup for texture.  Furthermore, sharks have high levels of mercury, which can become dangerous for people if they consume it regularly.</p>

          <p>Many of the sharks that are hunted are endangered species.  Sharks are incredibly important predators within the ocean ecosystem, and the practice of shark finning is not only cruel but also unsustainable because sharks have very slow reproduction rates.<br><br>If we do not act now, many more sharks will die.  <br><br>Click at the top to learn how to help.</p>
